According to books, fast fashion is stated as replicating recent high fashion trends by mass-producing them at a low cost. But it doesn't end there, slowly and gradually this will consume the values, originality, and credibility of the designs, and majorly affect the environment, with landfill covered in dead stock just lying out as total waste.
We believe it's time to break the cycle of fast fashion- no consumers, no producers!

There is hope waiting to bloom into a beautiful garden of fresh air with no toxins!

youtube#video,0v7f0KeNpv8,Wasted: Fast fashion is fueling our ecological crisis #beatpollution,2022-11-25T11:00:01Z,UN Environment Programme,"New season, new styles, buy more, buy cheap, move on, throw away: the pollution, waste, and emissions of fast fashion are fueling an ecological crisis. With the annual Black Friday sales due on 25 November, there is no better time to rethink what is bought, what is thrown away, and what it costs the planet.

Sustainable fashion and circularity in the textiles value chain is possible, yet this century the world‚Äôs consumers are buying more clothes and wearing them for less time than ever before, discarding garments as fast as trends shift.

UNEP is spearheading an initiative towards a zero waste world and, as part of this ambitious outlook, has partnered with Kenyan spoken word poet Beatrice Kariuki to shed light on high impact sectors where every individual can make a difference.

To fight the pervasive impact of pollution on society, UNEP launched #BeatPollution, a strategy for rapid, large-scale and coordinated action against air, land and water pollution. The strategy highlights the impact of pollution on climate change, nature and biodiversity loss, and human health. Through science-based messaging, the campaign showcases how transitioning to a pollution-free planet is vital for future generations.

We throw so much of fashion items away - but there's no such place as away!

Starting today, Vestiaire Collective is banning fast fashion from being bought, sold or listed on the platform. We say no to a system that supports overconsumption, poor quality and over production. 

Why ban fast fashion? Because fast fashion has no value, even in the resale industry. We‚Äôve taken this step because we don‚Äôt want to be complicit in an industry which has a tremendous environmental and social impact.

Today's move reinforces Vestiaire Collective's founding mission to drive change from within the fashion industry. We aim, over the next 3 years, to become a fast fashion-free platform that celebrates quality, craftsmanship and sustainability. This is because it takes time to do it right. We want to advocate for a better way of consuming fashion and offer alternatives to fast fashion.

Summary: This video examines the quickly growing problem of greenwashing, a series of public relations methods used by corporations to make misleading representations about the sustainability of their products and business practices. The video begins by introducing and defining the scope of greenwashing. It then describes how greenwashing has become a particular problem in advertising by the fast fashion industry. The heart of the video‚Äôs analysis focuses on a recently filed class action lawsuit which alleges that the clothing retail giant H&M engaged in advertising efforts that significantly mislead consumers about the sustainable nature of its
Conscious collection products.

Description: 

From the newest gadgets, to the newest clothes - we live in a consumer society. We also know that consumerism and overconsumption harms the climate- our tort report survey revealed that the majority of us consider climate change to be the #1 pressing problem that we face today. Our tort report explores the tension between consumer culture/individualism and its negative impact on climate change. We focus our inquiry on fast fashion - what is it, why is it so appealing, and what are the hidden forces driving consumer behavior?

It‚Äôs time for a fast takedown on another fast fashion company. Boohoo has become a competitive and notorious rival to Shein in the world of fast fashion and in scandals. They claim to be making a push for sustainability, but their 100% sale, and over 400,000 styles a year seem to beg a differ. As for the people that make all of their inventory, well, let's just say the company‚Äôs labor practice leaves something to be desired. But hey, Kourtney Kardashian says she is here to save the day!

youtube#video,6vjyPoJKMNo,Toxic Bomb - Fast Fashion,2022-11-10T15:10:29Z,Race For Water Foundation,"The intensity at which clothing is consumed is unprecedented and is now heavily impacting the environment. The use of plastic, mainly polyester, gives life to cheap and low-quality clothing designs creating a lot of problems during each step of textile creation. The extraction of fossil raw materials, the CO2 emissions during production and transportation, the chemicals used for dyeing the clothes, the micro fibers released during laundry, not to mention the lack of recycling infrastructure are all devastating to the environment. How can we talk about a value chain when at every moment of the creation of a new item of clothing the environment and thus human health is affected?

The fast fashion industry must slow down and change its business model entirely, or its economic success will cause tremendous damage to the environment. It is also up to consumers to ask themselves: Do I really need this?

youtube#video,bpNHrYxfg0Q,The top 2 ways fast fashion brands play to your psychology,2022-11-09T02:09:53Z,Aam,"The psychology of fast fashion is fascinating. On this episode of Inside Out, we talk about two ways in which fast fashion brands keep selling you product by playing to the psychology of human behavior. 

Brands like Shein put out thousands of new styles per day. How do they sell all those garments?

First, they deliberately make their products poor quality, so that the pieces will fall apart and you‚Äôll be forced to buy more. When we shop, we tend to think of purchases individually. How much did I spend on this item, or on this haul. Not, how much did I spend in total with this brand, over the course of the year. If we shifted our mindset to be more long-term, we‚Äôd realize how much the individual purchases add up. 

Second, they deliberately launch small quantities in each style, because constantly selling out tempts you into buying pieces that you‚Äôre not 100% sure about, before they‚Äôre gone.

youtube#video,mar7iLChaMc,Is fast fashion bad for your happiness? Let‚Äôs discuss,2022-11-08T07:37:03Z,Eco-Stylist,"We know fast fashion is bad for clothing makers and the environment, but is it also bad for your Happiness?

Many people think the appeal of fast fashion is the price, but that‚Äôs actually wrong. The appeal of fast fashion is that it‚Äôs so cheap you can afford to buy it all the time. It‚Äôs price paired with frequency of buying. 

The majority of fast fashion shoppers can afford to spend more on clothes IF they buy them less often. BUT they think the endless choices and options make them happier. 

Research suggest that these infinite choices are actually bad for your happiness.

When you have infinite choices you‚Äôre never satisfied, always looking for more. And when there‚Äôs a party next week you just buy something new. While we think more choice is good, This endless loop of decision making is exhausting and bad for our mental health.

Meanwhile the fast fashion CEOs capitalize on your unhappiness, becoming billionaires in the process. 

So how can you break the cycle of infinite choices and commit? 

1. Stop buying fast fashion. It‚Äôs the only way to remove yourself from a game that‚Äôs rigged to make you lose.

2. Start with your closet and think of new ways to commit to wearing what you already have

3. When buying new clothes buy less pieces of higher quality pieces. And buy from ethical and sustainable brands.

youtube#video,DKYnvzLpF2Q,ZARA : The Rise of Fast Fashion,2022-11-06T15:00:08Z,Brandaphy,"Everything from fast fashion is essentially a copy of a recent trend or design, which is then mass produced at a low cost and quickly distributed and sold in retail stores. This occurs in a fairly quick cycle, and most materials used in production are of low quality, allowing them to be easily discarded once a new trend enters the market. Cheap labor is also another problem, and the issue of sustainability is frequently debated.
If you believe there is a lot of money in this industry that would be an accurate asumption. The man who founded Zara and popularized fast fashion is currently Europe's third wealthiest person. He co-founded Inditex, a fast-fashion retail conglomerate that includes brands such as Zara, Pull & Brand, Bershka, Stradivarius, Massimo Dutti, Oysho, Zara Home, and Uterq√ºe in its portfolio.
Zara is the most popular fast-fashion retail brand there is and also produces the quickest.
In this video, we take a deeper look at how the Zara brand became as big as is it today and the strategies it has done over the years to continue dominating the fast-fashion industry.
Have you purchased anything from Zara? If so how was the quality of the clothes? Let us know in the comments below!

Amancio Ortega founded Inditex when he was almost 40, and today the fortune of a man who never graduated from school is estimated at about $100 billion.

It‚Äôs valued at around 100 Billion Dollars, and by 2026 it could reach 133 Billion dollars. More than 100 billion items of clothing are produced each year globally. That's nearly 14 items for every human being on the planet! However, around 33% of all those clothes go to a landfill within the first year of purchase. The EPA Office of Solid Waste says that Americans throw away more than 68 pounds of clothing and textiles per person every year. In this video, we will focus on how social media is playing a role in accelerating the fast fashion industry and explore how new short-term fashion trends are emerging as a result.

93% of brands aren‚Äôt paying garment workers a living wage (1) It is commonly known that fast fashion production facilities are located in countries referred to as emerging or developing markets for their cheap labour, whom work intensive hours, but payment is unfair.

Only 5 of the 250 large brands surveyed published a roadmap or strategy for how they will achieve a living wage for all workers across their supply chains (2).

68% of fast fashion brands don‚Äôt maintain gender equality at production facilities, with workers being overwhelmingly women. (3)

What should we do about it?

The fashion industry consumes a monstrous amount of water, around 93 billion cubic metres, leaving much of it contaminated by toxic chemicals. 

According to the UN Environment Programme, 20% of global wastewater comes from textile dyeing (1). Because the bulk of the production is in countries with less regulation, the wastewater often finds its way to rivers and seas. 

The dyeing process uses enough water to fill 2 million Olympic-sized swimming pools each year. (2)

In Bangladesh alone, 1,500 billion litres of water are used annually in garment factories and mills, depleting the region‚Äôs dwindling groundwater resources and transporting byproducts and harmful contaminants to nearby water sources.

What should we do about it?

An 2021 investigation by CBC found elevated levels of lead, phthalates, and and PFAS in Shein clothing for children and adults. These chemicals are linked to health problems such as weakening the immune system, liver and kidney damage, and disrupting the body's hormones.

Experts told @insider that many large clothing brands use toxic chemicals, and exposure can cause serious health problems over time. Children may face increased risk.

Testing by Mamavation found that yoga pants and gym leggings sold by Lululemon and Old Navy contained PFAS.

Substances like lead and phthalates may harm people manufacturing clothes more than consumers.

@joinourco estimates that 27 million people working in clothing manufacturing could suffer from work-related illnesses or diseases, including skin and respiratory conditions.

While I wish more companies were moving in a sustainable direction, these collections are more accessible and usually more affordable. They are an easy option for people who want to shop more sustainably but don't have the time to do their research or the money to buy from a sustainable brand. These actions can also snowball into people making the conscious choice in other parts of their life. Finally, when a brand comes out with a conscious collection and it does well, it encourages them to keep moving in this direction. What do you guys think?

According to Earth.org, Of the 100 billion garments produced each year, 92 million tonnes end up in landfills. (1)

To put things in perspective, this means that the equivalent of a rubbish truck full of clothes ends up on landfill sites every second. (2)

And more than just alarmingly, Americans throw away Approx 32 kilos or 70 lbs of clothing per person per year. (3)

We know fabrics can take up to 200 plus years in landfill to degrade, but according to Planet Aid, Shoes can take up to 1,000 years to break down. As they are commonly made with a material called ethylene viny.

It might be alarming to know that any garment made from synthetic fabrics (aka petroleum-based)  naturally shed tiny plastic particles when you wear and wash them. And there are billions and billions of these garments alone, hanging in our closets across the world.

These microplastics are small, less than 5 millimetres in length, and are small enough to pass through water filtration processes. And In¬†a study¬†(2) of tapwater samples from around the globe, 83% of them were found to contain plastic particles.

The 2019 State of Fashion Report¬†found that one in three young women consider a garment worn once or twice to be old, and one in seven consider it a fashion faux-pas to be photographed in the same outfit twice.¬†(1)

The throwaway culture has worsen progressively over the years. At present, many items are worn only seven to ten times before being thrown away. (2) 

Not only is this a waste of money and resources, but it can take 200+ years for the materials to decompose in a landfill, while generating the highly toxic greenhouse gas methane; and leaking toxic chemicals and dyes into the groundwater and our soil. (3)

What should we do about it?

üå± UNSUBSCRIBE: unfollow & unsubscribe from brands that flood your inbox or social feeds to reduce the temptation to shop.

üå±SPARK JOY: Get clear on what you actually enjoy wearing the most to remove any pressure to follow the current trends.

üå±FIND A NEW FAV: Find better alternatives for adding new clothes to your closet, whether that‚Äôs thrifting, shopping small businesses whose values align with yours, or swapping with your fashionable friends.

üå±GO FOR 30: I LOVE the 30 Wear Rule! Before you buy, ask yourself ‚ÄúWill I wear this at least 30 times?‚Äù If the answer is no, then you don‚Äôt buy it.

üå±NO MORE IMPULSE BUYS: Create a designated time to add new-to-you pieces to your wardrobe and refuse any impulse purchases. This could be seasonally, when your old favs wear out, as a special treat at the end of the month- whatever works best for you.

üå±BE A PROUD OUTFIT REPEATER: I mean, why wear your favorite looks only once?! Think of it as your Badass Uniform üòé

üå±REMEMBER YOUR WHY: Having a clear vision and mission will help you stay focused on your intention to cultivate a more sustainable wardrobe.

Drop a üå± in the comments if you‚Äôre ready to breakup with fast fashion! I‚Äôd also love to hear what tips you guys have found helpful- let‚Äôs learn together! üíõüíõ

It‚Äôs a trend that has been around for decades, but it‚Äôs only recently that we‚Äôve started to see the consequences of this industry. The industry has been criticized for its negative impacts on the environment and human rights violations. #Dharavi is a hub of the global #fastfashion industry. It‚Äôs also home to the largest slum in Asia, and one of the most densely populated places on earth.  Inside its boundaries live some of the most vulnerable workers in the world. They work long hours in unsafe conditions and are paid less than $2 a day.  In this video we will explore the industry of fast fashion and how it affects the people living in #dharavi

youtube#video,yds_H5d20e8,What is Fast Fashion? #shorts,2022-09-25T18:00:16Z,Saveourplanetio,"Fast fashion describes cheap, trendy clothes with a short lifespan ‚Äì and an industry responsible for human rights abuses and heavy environmental damage.‚Å†
‚Å†
Fast fashion designs are often based on high fashion and celebrity style. Brands produce multiple collections each season, following trends as they emerge ‚Äì it might only take days for an item featured on an influencer‚Äôs Instagram to be replicated and put up for sale. The clothing quality is usually poor, further shortening the lifespan of an item.‚Å†
‚Å†
This is a relatively new type of consumerism, emerging in the 1990s with the popularity of high street shops such as H&M and Zara, due to the low costs of manufacturing in developing countries and transportation. Today, fast fashion is even ‚Äòfaster‚Äô, fronted by cheap online fashion brands such as Boohoo and Shein.‚Å†
‚Å†
The items are typically produced by low-paid, exploited workers in countries such as Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. The factory conditions are often dangerous. Toxic chemicals can cause respiratory illnesses and skin irritation, and there are multiple reports of child labour and sexual harassment in sweatshops.‚Å†
‚Å†
Fast fashion is bad for the environment, too. Chemicals, for example, can pollute waterways. Polyester is made using fossil fuels and sheds microplastics. Cotton requires vast amounts of water to produce.‚Å†

We need to reset the way we shop.‚Å†
‚Å†
The answer isn‚Äôt demonising people who buy cheap clothing ‚Äì that might be down to budget rather than choice. And there‚Äôs nothing wrong with very occasionally buying something that you might only wear a handful of times ‚Äì but let‚Äôs not make it the norm.‚Å†

Introducing Glide and our first innovation: The removable sole, made from car tire particles.
To drop some knowledge‚Ä¶ Car tyres shred while driving, polluting rubber dust in the atmosphere, resulting in being the second highest microplastics in our oceans.
After inventing this solution to mitigate 22 billion shoes going to landfills every year, we were then hooked on breaking further Industry norms.
We then went on to create our own material made from tire dust!

Salah satu cara yang dilakukan agar bisa fashionable adalah dengan mix and match outfit yang akan kamu gunakan. Tapi, untuk bisa seperti itu, biasanya kamu akan membeli outfit terlebih dahulu. Betul nggak? 

Dan tanpa disadari, kebiasaan ‚Äòmembeli‚Äô ini terus berlangsung. Apalagi kalau ada tren terbaru yang dibanderol dengan harga relatif murah. Siapa yang nggak tergiur kalau sudah begini.

Tapi, tahu nggak? Outfit yang kamu beli atau bahkan yang sedang kamu pakai saat ini mungkin merupakan hasil dari fast fashion lho. Mirisnya, fast fashion ini punya dampak buruk ke lingkungan, bahkan manusia itu sendiri. Kok Bisa?

youtube#video,Y4USU3nH80Y,SIREN: how fast fashion is destroying our planet.,2022-09-02T21:50:02Z,Evae Todd,"I wanted to create a wearable garment which reflected the negative impact of fast fashion and the effect it has upon the planet in order to illustrate our need for sustainability within the fashion industry and how it is key in order for our planet to survive. 

The fashion industry is the second largest polluter in the world just after the oil industry and creates over 80 billion garments per year; this is a 400 percent increase from two decades ago.

To put this type of pollution into perspective for you an article released by Oxfam stated:

‚ÄúFast fashion produces more carbon emissions per minute than driving a car around the world six times.‚Äù

From this, I began looking at the concept of disposability and how our consumer culture continues to overindulge and be wasteful. 
This idea then sort of spiralled into looking at the natural world of coral and the impact fast fashion has upon it. As you progress down the dress it changes from being this bright, vibrant garment to a pale, clear dress in order to show the process of coral bleaching and the destruction caused by water consumption, and rising sea temperatures. 

A key thing for me when making this dress was for it to be made of entirely recycled materials and things that would‚Äôve otherwise been thrown away. This ranged from plastic bottles to scrap wool to old jeans. 

I made the dress to fit me so the intention was always for it to eventually be modelled on a beach in order to take photos of it. 
My incredibly talented brother produced and created a short film in order to help me to fully exhibit the details of the garment. The powerful message I hope this short film produces really wouldn‚Äôt have been able to be achieved without him. 

Everything has been entirely handmade in order to show the lengthy and laborious process it takes to make a garment. 

Thank you for watching and i hope this encourages you take action in your own individual lives by making wiser choices when it comes to the clothes you indulge in.

youtube#video,RwZi6hYmznA,Pretty Little Thing Launches Pre-Loved Fast Fashion Marketplace App #shorts,2022-09-02T09:26:20Z,Frooition,"Fast fashion brand, Pretty Little Thing, has launched a marketplace app enabling users to buy and sell second-hand clothing. The PLT marketplace joins an already crowded market, including fashion-specific brands like Depop and Vinted, along with traditional online marketplaces like eBay, which are rapidly rediscovering their love for pre-loved items.

eBay and PLT are clearly targeting a similar audience, with both brands investing heavily in promotions linked to the reality TV series Love Island. eBay sponsored the last reality show series, providing contestants with pre-loved fashions, and recently announced a collaboration with the Islander Tasha Ghouri. Meanwhile, PLT has just announced a six-figure deal with Tasha‚Äôs fellow Islander, Indiyah Polack, to represent the fashion retailer as a brand ambassador.

Reconnecting to our family heritage has been an incredible journey. 

In 2020, we decided to move to Peru, and a year later we opened our studio in Lima. 

Our mission is to create the most sustainable brand in the world, without falling into the trap of greenwashing. To do this, we decided to vertically integrate and learn as much as we can about the textile supply chain: sourcing fibers, spinning/knitting/weaving machinery, textile dyeing and finishing, and garment making. 

So far, we have been able to greatly reduce our carbon footprint, remove all the plastics from our clothes, and introduce a natural dye catalog. There is still a long road ahead, but we know that to make a real change we will have to share this journey with you.

The biggest fast-fashion retailer is Shein, which many people have never heard of. The Chinese company has quickly established itself as a one-stop shop for absurdly affordable, diverse, and superior women's clothing. On their website, more than 5,000 new things are added each day. Additionally, a large number of influencers as well as well-known stars like Katy Perry and Lil Nas X have joined the Shein ecosystem. It sold about $10 billion worth of clothing in sales last year, almost matching the market leader, Inditex, the parent firm of Zara. The brand, however, remains essentially a mystery to the media and investors even though it has become popular among Gen Zers and the fashion business.",970,34

Then comes the guilt and disappointment, followed by a new purchase for a fresh hit of dopamine - repeat repeat repeat.

It‚Äôs time to break the cycle of fast fashion.

Choosing jewelry that has a deeper meaning and resonates with your purpose means you feel great every single time you put it on.

Bonus: when jewelry is made with quality materials it also lasts way longer than any of the cheap baubles at the fast fashion chains.

In this Our Changing Climate climate change video essay, I look at why fast fashion must end. Specifically, I look at the horrors of both worker and planetary exploitation of the fashion industry. The history of fashion parallels that of industrial capitalism. The pollution and worker exploitation of 18th and 19th-century textile mills and factories have just been upgraded and exported to the 21st century. Today with brands like ASOS, Shein, and H&M fashion has turned fast fashion into ultra-fast fashion with extremely quick turnarounds and daily style releases crushing workers in the imperial periphery and pumping emissions into the atmosphere. The current state of the fashion industry is destroying our planet and our very lives.

Or when you outgrew your clothes. and all you had was your style to maintain any semblance of sanity. But things speeded up around 2 decades ago. Fast fashion happened. And with it came monumental changes.

It led to a toxic system of excess production and consumption, leading to fashion turning into the world‚Äôs greatest polluters.

youtube#video,IhyUdHaTspc,I QUIT FAST FASHION üö´ Here's why... #shorts #youtubeshorts #sustainablefashion,2022-08-12T18:56:35Z,Talea Griseta,"My heart is constantly heavy thinking about how the fast fashion industry ruthlessly takes advantage of people and our planet. Child labor is very real (as young as 2 years old!) and a lot of people are unaware of this, as well as the many alternatives to fast fashion. 

Sustainable and intentional style looks different for everyone, but as long as we're all doing something to combat the overflowing landfills, toxic pollution, and unfair treatment of the hardworking people who make our clothing that's really all that matters.

Here are some things we can do:

‚Ä¢WASH CLOTHES LESS and only with cold water (unless you're sick or something and really need to sanitize them)- this keeps your clothes looking their best, reduces the amount of water and energy used, plus lessens the amount of chemicals being drained back into our water sources.
‚Ä¢SHOP SECONDHAND- I prefer online thrift stores and marketplaces, like Thredup, Etsy, Mercari & Depop because shopping for specific pieces isn't as overwhelming
‚Ä¢SHOP SUSTAINABLE & ETHICAL slow fashion brands- just beware of greenwashing and thoroughly check them out before purchasing 
‚Ä¢SWAP with a friend- this used to be a thing and we need to bring it back! 
‚Ä¢CONSUME LESS and spend more time getting creative with your wardrobe- clothing can be so fun to play with and finding new ways to wear them allows you to bring life back into your wardrobe
‚Ä¢MEND any damaged clothes and tailor the ones that don't fit perfectly to get the most use out of them
‚Ä¢DONATE clothing and use the unsalvageable garments for rags or upcycling 
‚Ä¢EDUCATE yourself on this and share with others!

It is Documentary by  Arthur Speiser Media  about world of fast fashion,  Shady world of clothing  and its effect on our planet.
Clothe production has doubled since the early 2000‚Äôs with over 120 billion of clothes produced annually. The Internet and social media have been major contributors to this acceleration.
Clothes renting companies such as Nuuly and Rent the Runway have shown that we don‚Äôt necessarily need to buy new clothes to look good.
We want new clothes fast and cheap to meet the new fashion trends everyone is talking about. The feeling of being left out simply doesn‚Äôt sit right with us, so how can we make this possible? That‚Äôs where fast fashion companies such as ZARA, H&M and SHEIN come into play. These fast fashion companies meet consumer demand by setting incredibly low prices that appease to the ever-growing market.
The environmental damage this type of business has caused is simply alarming. In an era of growing climate consciousness, it is astonishing how this is even possible. 
Fast fashion is usually cheap poorly made clothing usually produced in bulk, in response to the latest trends. The industry accounts for about 10% global carbon emission and approximately 20% of global water pollution annually.

1- The world of fast fashion

Wearing the right clothes makes us feel more attractive, confident, empowered, and boosts our self-esteem. We want to participate in wearing some of the fabulous fashions we see on the Hollywood red carpet for a fraction of the price. Fast fashion makes this possible. BUT, there‚Äôs a darker side. The clothing industry has a disastrous impact on our environment. It's second only to the oil industry as a global polluter and millions of tons of clothing end up in landfills each year.

We're really embarrassed to say that Noor is the first woman to be featured on ClimateStory. We're also super proud to say that she delivered an inspirational, motivating, and joyful narration that is perhaps the best we've had on this channel. 

Noor shines with authenticity and while she is not the CEO of the company she co-founded, she certainly is the heart of the company: We imagine that her values and determination are great asset on her dream-team of three woman, all with impressive academic backgrounds and a hunger for activism and social change. 

Project CeCe is changing how consumers discover great sustainable brands. They call it the best search engine for brands who go the extra mile to protect the planet and their stakeholders. And we think they maybe right.

There's a common misconception that in order to dress sustainably, one must don a burlap sack and homemade knitted cardigans. Thankfully that's not the case. (Unless that's your vibe, in which case, rock on ‚úåÔ∏è)

Fashion is an awesome way to express yourself. And there are plenty of ways to still have fun with your personal style without contributing to the 92 million tonnes of textiles waste that goes to landfill each year ü§Ø",63,1
youtube#video,Fp79Cz7jtz4,So can we stop treating our bodies like fast fashion k thx #shorts #beauty #bodypositive,2022-07-13T16:00:14Z,blogilates,"I saw a pic of Khloe Kardashian recently and boy does she look different. I mean, she looks incredible, but people are claiming she removed her butt implants! Which made me think‚Ä¶uh oh‚Ä¶it‚Äôs time for a shift in the female beauty standard üôÑ

So, let‚Äôs revisit this experiment that I originally published in 2018: 

What I would look like if I had the ‚Äúperfect body‚Äù throughout history.

2018-2020s:
Small waist, big butts, wide hips, thicc thighs, tiny waists, and full lips are in! There is a huge surge in plastic surgery for butt implants thanks to the rise of Instagram booty models. Even cosmetic surgery doctors have become IG-famous for reshaping women.

2010s:
All I remember is someone asking me for a thigh gap workout on Tumblr. I didn‚Äôt even know what that was. Then‚Ä¶the thigh gap became a full fledged obsession for girls all across the internet.

2000s:
Big boobs and flat stomachs are in. Breast augmentation is the highest performed cosmetic surgery in the United States in this era. üëô It‚Äôs the age of the Victoria‚Äôs Secret Angel.

1990s:
THIN IS IN. Having angular bone structure, looking emaciated, and being super skinny is what‚Äôs dominating the runways and the magazine covers. Its called ‚Äúheroin chic‚Äù.

1950s:
The hourglass shape is in. ‚è≥ Elizabeth Taylor‚Äòs 36-21-36 measurements are the ideal. Marilyn Monroe‚Äôs soft voluptuousness is lusted after. Women are advertised weight gaining pills to fill themselves out. Playboy magazine and Barbie are created in this decade.

1920s:
Appearing boyish, androgynous and youthful, with minimal breasts, and a straight figure is in! Women are hiding their curves, and are doing so by binding their chests with strips of cloth to create that straight figure suitable for flapper dresses.

1400s-1700s:
The Italian Renaissance ‚Äì Looking full with a rounded stomach, large hips, and an ample bosom is in. Being well fed is a sign of wealth and status. Only the poor are thin.

And here we are in 2022. Can we finally stop treating female bodies like fast fashion? It‚Äôs time.

üåü About this video:
You probably already guessed, but I have a bit of an obsessive personality ü§ì What am I currently obsessing over? Well right now, it's fragrance. I also drool over vintage clothes, but pre pandemic, I also loved Topshop, Warehouse, Oasis, New Look and Primark; some well known UK fast fashion brands. I didn't buy a lot, but I was, for sure, someone who couldn't resist a fast fashion bargain...

I now see a few parallels between my perfume purchasing and consumption, its economics, marketing and lifecycle, as well the influence of social media on my choices, just like with fast fashion clothing (and actually makeup too).

Like many others, I watched those shocking fast fashion documentaries a few years ago and saw those piles of waste. These days, I try to limit the amount of new clothing that I buy. My wardrobe is around 30% secondhand, but what about fragrance? Well it's similar really, I do buy a lot of secondhand fragrances, I resell them if I no longer want them and I am trying to sample more, but I am far from perfect.

Here I discuss the issue of fast fashion fragrances, show you the vast amount of money generated in the fragrance industry and its eye-watering year on year unsustainable growth. I will also highlight a few social media concepts that will be incredibly familiar to you, but in essence, are just plain nuts, and have certainly contributed to the almost disposal feel to perfumes today.

Please let me know what you think! Have you had similar thoughts? Is perfume a fast fashion industry or not? Do channel owners need to be more responsible or is it just entertainment? Do you think YouTube normalises over consumption?

The term ""#fast #fashion"" refers to a sizable part of the #fashion industry that operates on the principle of producing low-quality apparel at low cost, in a short amount of time, and in big quantities. 

Although items with low pricing and those that represent the most recent fashion trends are immensely appealing, particularly to younger buyers, the #environmental and social implications of the sector are sometimes #ignored.
 
Here are ten truths about fast fashion that you should be aware of so that you may become a more ethical shopper.

In the 1990's, Fashion became more accessible to the general public, and it gradually evolved into a work of art. Low-cost design achieved its pinnacle in the late 1990s and early 2000s.
And then we entered the era of Fast Fashion‚Äîcheap, trendy knock-offs mass-produced at minimal cost that allowed customers to feel as if they were wearing the same fashions that ""walked the runway"" or were sported by their favorite entertainer.
It appears to be too good to be true. All of these places sell cool, trendy stuff that you could buy with your free change or an extra discount, wear a handful of times, and toss away after.
Fast fashion became popular as a result of cheaper, faster manufacturing and shipping technologies, increased consumer demand for up-to-date styles, and increased consumer purchasing power‚Äîparticularly among young people‚Äîto satisfy these instant-gratification desires.
However, some critics say that fast fashion has long-term detrimental economic and environmental consequences.

youtube#video,5_Gk5I-N1jg,Fast Fashion CEOs Can Be Created Or Destroyed By Shopping Habits,2022-07-05T16:00:07Z,Bold TV,"Can fashion billionaires last? Check out the video to learn more.

Welcome back to Bold TV with David Grasso. Be sure to like, comment, and subscribe to Bold TV for all things Bold.

Our shopping habits both build and destroy fashion billionaires.

Let's take a look at the Forever 21 founders, who went from being multi-billionaires to bankrupt. Jin Sook and Dong Cheng were Korean immigrants who settled in California and built a fortune selling fashionable, reasonably priced clothing that you've certainly seen at the mall.

They were a part of the Americanization of quick fashion. The Forever 21 founders had more than $6 billion in wealth and operated stores all over the world by 2015. They were quickly growing.

The company was at its peak, but sales were suddenly being eaten away by E-brands and H&M. By 2020, firms like Wet Seal and American Apparel had already declared bankruptcy, and Jin and Dong were no longer billionaires.

Forever 21 is still around today, however, it is now owned by the same business as Barneys and Aeropostale.

Fast fashion is still a goldmine, and other fast fashion companies like H&M and Zara are growing. Amancio Ortega is the CEO of Zara and is currently valued close to $58 billion.

What do you think of fast fashion brands making these CEOs billionaires? Let us know in the comments below.

In this video I have explained about The Dark Side Of Fast Fashion. There are many unknown and hidden secrets in this Fast Fashion industry that you never heard of. You know the workers where they made our clothes they get paid the half of the lowest minimum salary and forced to work for 14-16 hours a day. Even about 5-7 years kid work there and the worst part is about women workers that they have to face violence and sexual assault. But still we as consumers are desperate to buy these clothes and also throw away it just after 3-5 uses and just for next trends and low quality materials that are not only harming human's lives but also polluting weather, water and the whole environment. You know how much water it takes to produce 1kg cotton it is about 20,000 ltr and if you want to know these about Tshirt and Jeans watch the complete video and if you found it insightful share it further and help others.

If you've ever wondered how you can do more with less, invest in quality pieces and reduce textile waste, she walks us through how to take 5 staple wardrobe pieces from day to night. 

""My greatest passion lies in helping people understand that the most sustainable wardrobe is actually the one you already own. Yes‚Äîthe very garments that are already hanging in your closet- no matter where they came from. The longer you wear the wardrobe that you already possess the better you are doing for the environment.""

General Mariano Alvarez Technical High School about fast fashion and its environmental impact, providing the current state of individual awareness and acknowledgment of fast fashion and its underlying effects. Fast fashion is the mass production of cheap clothes that were made for short term use and the cycle of fast is unsustainable as it takes and takes and keeps on taking from our resources which would be then made into clothes and the end for those  clothes in landfills because those clothes are made to be thrown away as it  follows the ""trend"" The fast fashion industry over the years has been rapidly  growing as it captures the attention of many, especially the younger generation,  but its growth comes at a cost which is our environment. Giving them resolution and responsive actions, they can do to ease and 
lessen the negative impacts. The researchers gathered information related to  the study was done by researching and inquiring to different people using a survey questionnaire and going places that can provide information such as 
libraries and using modern primary and secondary resources (internet).

The conducted study and survey with ninety-seven (97) participants  were evaluated by the researchers to assess the information and interpret them  into numerical data. To come up with a conclusion about the awareness rate, 
environmental impacts (positive and negative), and actions that needed to be  done to lessen the negative impacts.

youtube#video,5B05ChrCYbQ,Fast Fashion - Original Song,2022-06-17T04:10:14Z,E Is For Everything,"it's been a hot minute, and the only reason i even wrote this song was for my english class. but honestly, i'm pretty happy with the way this turned out. but yeah, life has been hectic (i feel like i say that 24/7) but it's been more hectic than ever. i blew up on instagram recently, received my first semi-death threat woohoo, and yeah, it's been a lot. i am going to uni soon which is very exciting!

ALSO as much as i do call out fast fashion in this song, i cannot deny the fact that i myself am a contributor to fast fashion. i do try to be conscious of what i buy - i genuinely do try to buy organic cotton shirts as much as possible, but sometimes it's not as easy as it seems for so many reasons. fast fashion is such a complex problem, there is no one solution to the many problems that come out of it.

Lyrics:
Verse
Wake up  
Choose an outfit 
Can‚Äôt repeat what you wore yesterday 
You don‚Äôt wanna fade 

Put on your shirt 
Notice a rip 
Better throw out that later 
Instead of fixing it 
‚ÄòCause you don‚Äôt wanna stitch 

Chorus
That‚Äôs fast fashion 
Grabbing trends and throwing them out 
You don‚Äôt wanna look so bad 
Rather sacrifice all of that 

That‚Äôs fast fashion
Wear cheap clothes, made out of plastic 
A year they don‚Äôt even last 
While you put someone in a cast 

Post chorus
To look a little cooler 
Using two thousand seven hundred litres of water 
Just to dump it in the river 
Doesn‚Äôt it make you shiver?

Verse
Laundry 
Clothes shed 
Microplastics fall off the crochet vest 
And I would bet that 

It‚Äôs in the waterways 
The fish that you ate today 
Your body and the water you drank 
That fifteen dollar crochet vest is invested in everything 

Chorus
That‚Äôs fast fashion 
Grabbing trends and throwing them out 
You don‚Äôt wanna look so bad 
Rather sacrifice all of that 

That‚Äôs fast fashion 
Wear cheap clothes, made out of plastic 
A year they don‚Äôt even last 
While you put someone in a cast 

Post chorus
To look a little cooler
Using two thousand seven hundred litres of water 
Just to dump it in the river 
Doesn‚Äôt it make you shiver?",829,19

Il colosso della fast fashion cinese una volta, era un mio partner. Sul mio vecchio canale facevo spesso video-haul di shein che in questo momento sono stati oscurati, per ovvie ragioni. Spero che la mia esperienza possa aiutarvi a ragionare insieme sul concetto di capitalismo, consumismo e risparmio economico. Ecco come ho rivoluzionato la mia vita smettendo di acquistare, iniziando a risparmiare soldi e sentrndomi pi√π libera.

Fast fashion garment production leverages trend replication and low-quality materials (like synthetic fabrics) in order to bring inexpensive styles to the end consumer.

Fast fashion is not bringing any good at all to the environment, clothing, employees and consumers.
These cheaply made, trendy pieces have resulted in an industry-wide movement towards overwhelming amounts of consumption. This results in harmful impacts on the environment, garment workers, animals, and, ultimately, consumers‚Äô wallets.

Cheers to all those making everyday efforts to be more sustainable! There are commitments to emphasize this in the environmental science practices but everyone need to take one step ahead.",317,9

Ese es uno de los objetivos que se propuso la Comisi√≥n Europea el pasado marzo, bajo el marco del Pacto Verde Europeo, que busca convertir el continente en una regi√≥n ‚Äúclim√°ticamente neutra‚Äù, es decir, que no produzca emisiones netas de gases de efecto invernadero en el a√±o 2050.

Parad√≥jicamente, esta informaci√≥n podr√≠a estar detr√°s del ‚Äòp√°nico‚Äô que se desat√≥ en redes sociales en torno al portal asi√°tico de moda Shein. El rumor sobre su cierre en Europa provoc√≥ que miles de usuarios, alarmados, planearan sus √∫ltimos pedidos de ropa en la gran plataforma china antes de que alguna instituci√≥n ‚Äìlleg√≥ a hablarse hasta de la Organizaci√≥n Mundial de la Salud (OMS)‚Äì cerrara sus puertas a sus clientes europeos.

Lejos de marcharse, la compa√±√≠a instalar√° en Espa√±a una tienda ‚Äòpop up‚Äô. Durante cuatro d√≠as, del 2 al 5 de junio, Shein dispondr√° de un establecimiento f√≠sico en Madrid, a escasos metros de uno de sus principales competidores ‚ÄìZara‚Äì, y al que se prev√© que cientos de personas se desplacen para adquirir prendas low cost sin esperar a que lleguen a casa.

Pese a que ni Shein ni ninguna otra marca dejar√° de operar en Europa a corto plazo, cada vez son m√°s las demandas para que el sector de la moda reajuste su modelo de negocio. No solo para adaptarse al marco legislativo de los pa√≠ses en los que operan, sino porque garantizar la sostenibilidad medioambiental exige cambios dr√°sticos.

The fashion giant outperformed TikTok and Instagram on the Apple App store and was far ahead of Amazon.  

Since 2015, Shein has become a leader in its industry, initiating a new era of fashion experts call ‚Äúreal-time retail.‚Äù 

‚ÄúWhat Shein has done is, it has established a new norm, which is real time,‚Äù Allison Malmsten of Daxue Consulting told CNBC in an interview.  

‚ÄúIt is very fast, and the products are updated much more frequently and at a higher volume than any other fast fashion brand.‚Äù 

But its name has also been marred by trademark infringement allegations and questions about the sustainability of its manufacturing process ‚Äî controversies some experts say could threaten the startup‚Äôs investment prospects.  

‚ÄúIf it wants to IPO and if it wants to gather investments, then it really has to come clear and people really need to have peace of mind about what is happening at the company,‚Äù Malmsten said. 

Watch the video above to learn more about Shein‚Äôs rise, successes and challenges.

youtube#video,QicSkPNx4Ho,Fast fashion - Dumped in the desert | DW Documentary,2022-05-31T16:00:27Z,DW Documentary,"Huge heaps of used and unsold clothes have piled up in the Atacama desert in Chile in recent years. A symbol of the hidden cost of fast fashion, they show the industry‚Äôs disastrous environmental impact.

Manuela Olivos lives in a hut surrounded by mountains of discarded clothes. She makes a living from this vast, fast-fashion dumping ground in the Atacama desert in northern Chile, collecting anything that she can sell. Much of it is unsold clothing from more economically developed countries, where the demands of the fast fashion industry have resulted in chronic over-production. The garments that end up here are usually made of synthetic fabrics that are non-biodegradable. 

The desert dumping ground is an embarrassment to the authorities in nearby Alto Hospicio. Edgar Ortega works in the city‚Äôs environmental department, and says he‚Äôs powerless to do anything about it. New shipments of used clothing arrive at the dumping ground every week. ""The business with used clothing is highly lucrative for dealers in the free trade zone of Iquique, who import secondhand textiles,"" he says. ""But only for them. It‚Äôs detrimental to the wider community.""

Iquique, the provincial capital, used to be economically depressed. But then the Chilean government built a container port here and created the free trade zone known as ""Zofri"". 59,000 tonnes of used clothes are shipped here every year. According to estimates, up to 40 % of that is dumped - and ends up in the desert. 

Many of the people who sift through the mountains of discarded clothes are refugees from Venezuela. They‚Äôre looking for clothes they can wear themselves and for anything they can sell. We meet Andr√© and his family, who are braving the midday heat on their way to Iquique, where they hope to find work. They still have another 200 kilometers to go and are exhausted. 

Like many other Venezuelan refugees, they could well end up making a living from the mountains of textiles in the Atacama‚Äôs desert‚Äôs cemetery for used clothes.

Who doesn‚Äôt love denim jeans? The iconic symbol of American fashion has become one of the most essential pieces of our wardrobes. But how does this fabric impact the environment? It takes approximately 1,800 gallons of water to grow enough cotton to produce just one pair of jeans- that sad fact is part of the answer to this question. We decided to test four jeans from four fast fashion brands that are labeled as ‚Äúsustainable‚Äù and are supposedly made of more eco-friendly materials. Are they worth being part of the eco collection? How did they perform in terms of sustainability, textile certifications, transparency, durability and quality? Let‚Äôs find out!

youtube#video,kyULaHMgR8Y,Uptown Cheapskate tackles the fast-fashion crisis one outfit at a time,2022-04-28T19:43:47Z,Florida Focus Newsbreak,"With the fashion industry being the second largest consumer of the world‚Äôs clean water supply, it is crucial to find solutions. Uptown Cheapskate in Tampa Palms is doing its part to combat the fast fashion crisis. 

Uptown Cheapskate is a thrift store where you can sell and buy used clothing. You can clear out your wardrobe in exchange for quick cash or 25% more in in-store credit.

‚ÄúThrift stores have always been around, and I feel like they will always be around,‚Äù says Amber Watt, the owner of Uptown Cheapskate. ‚ÄúThey only serve good in the community. They are able to offer substantial discounts to people who need it, and I think there will always be people who need it.‚Äù

Choosing to buy clothing at thrift stores allows you to find one-of-a-kind pieces that are different from the mass-made items you would normally find in a fast-fashion store.

The steps to sell your clothes to Uptown Cheapskate are: First, clean out your closet of any unwanted, like-new, freshly laundered and stylish clothes, shoes or accessories. Bring them in a bin or hamper preferably and transfer them in the bins once you arrive. Then, the staff at the store will sort through your clothes and pay you on the spot. It‚Äôs a very simple process.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre rehoming something that somebody else didn‚Äôt want and you can cater your wardrobe in a way that makes your wardrobe different from others,‚Äù says Breanna Carter, who manages the thrift store. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going to have really custom, unique pieces that other people might not have.‚Äù

Selling and buying clothing at thrift stores such as Uptown Cheapskate not only helps you save money and boost your personal style but helps prevent clothing from ending up in landfills. You are also guaranteed quality clothing that will last years, compared to current fast fashion brands, which are being worn very few times before being thrown away.

Clothing production is the third biggest manufacturing industry after the automotive and technology industries. Textile production contributes more to climate change than international aviation and shipping combined, according to a report by the U.K. House of Commons Environmental Audit Committee.

All of the clothes not being sold by fast-fashion brands are either thrown out or burned, not donated. As a result, around $500 billion worth of clothes is lost every year.

Many fast-fashion brands also do not pay their workers a living wage while having them work ridiculous hours in bad conditions, the British audit found.

Secondhand clothes have a positive social and environmental impact. They reduce carbon emissions, save lots of resources, water and energy. They also prevent old clothing from ending up in landfills or incinerators.

While attempting to make a difference regarding the fast-fashion crisis can be overwhelming, simple changes can end up making a big impact. Choosing to shop second-hand is an easy way to do what‚Äôs right for your wallet and our planet.

Now that the weather is heating up, Uptown Cheapskate is seeking summer styles. Sell and buy your summer wardrobe now.

youtube#video,VC5KYX74AP4,Ghana: fast fashion's dumping ground | Unreported World,2022-04-10T14:00:25Z,Unreported World,"Unreported World is in Ghana which is suffering an environmental disaster caused by the fast fashion items we give away. Reporter Ashionye Ogene travels to the bustling market of Kantamanto in the capital city Accra to meet the traders struggling to sell the disposable clothes we no longer want. 

Kantamanto was once home to textile traders making a good living from so-called ‚ÄòDead White Man‚Äôs Clothes‚Äô, items donated from the West believed to be so good that only dead people would part with them. But the arrival of fast fashion is changing that. In 2019 around 63 million kilograms of clothes were imported into Ghana from the UK, much of it cheap and damaged fast fashion donated by us. 

But campaigners are deeply concerned about the impact of plastics found in much of our fast fashion. On the beaches of Accra, Ogene discovers a waterfall of mangled clothing flowing from the city‚Äôs sewers straight into the ocean. We meet scientists who believe that well known brands now embedded in the sand shed microfibres into the water. Their research has found clothing related plastics in seafood along the west coast of Africa.    

While creative solutions are being found, we meet the government minister tasked with finding a balance between banning imports to safeguard the environment, and protecting the livelihoods of thousands of traders.

Imagine the environmental impact of that!!

Fast fashion is a $35 billion segment within a broader apparel and footwear market expected to crack $3 trillion this decade. The traditional retail brands replaces products twice a year, while the fast fashion brands spot a new trend and work to bring it into the market as quickly as possible.

youtube#video,Vxc5a6g6-6w,La storia del fast fashion: come nascono i vestiti a basso costo e perch√© sono un problema?,2022-03-09T16:33:02Z,Will Media,"Ogni anno introduciamo nel mondo pi√π di 100 miliardi di nuovi capi di abbigliamento, e ogni secondo un camion pieno di tessuti √® bruciato o buttato in discarica, dove nella maggior parte dei casi impiegher√† pi√π di un secolo per biodegradarsi.

√à una della conseguenze della cosiddetta ""moda istantanea"", o ""fast fashion"".

Ma i costi nascosti del nostro abbigliamento non sono solo legati agli sprechi. I capi sono nella maggior parte dei casi confezionati da milioni di lavoratori tessili sottopagati e sfruttati, senza diritti n√© tutela. 

Grande responsabilit√† le ha il mercato del fast fashion, l'industria dell'abbigliamento che produce collezioni ispirate all'alta moda, rinnovate in tempi brevissimi e vendute a prezzi bassi. 

Ma come nasce l'industria dei vestiti a basso costo? E perch√© √® un problema? Con Silvia Lazzaris scopriamo la storia del fast fashion.

It can be confusing to navigate sustainable fashion as there are many misconceptions about the best ways to participate in the movement. Expensive ethical brands are not the only, or the best, alternative to fast fashion. In fact, the best alternatives cost less or nothing at all.

Every year, more precisely every June 5, we commemorate World Environment Day, CIMSA UNAIR presents LATERESPON. The project aims to celebrate, to support sustainable fashion, and to raise awareness about fast fashion. 

The main event was held online and offline on 9 January 2022 in the form of Webinars and Talk Shows using ZOOM Teleconference Meeting and a workshop held at Space K, Jl. Raya Darmo Permai III No.54. By holding this event, we hope that all LATERESPON 2022 events can provide many benefits for the community so that they can increase awareness regarding fast fashion and support the sustainable and ethical fashion industry to move forward.
