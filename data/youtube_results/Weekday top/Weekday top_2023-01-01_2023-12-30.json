And be it a complete veg meal for my non-veg eating family, my kids know mom will always try to bring out the best. The secret ingredient to any dish that\u2019s cooked at home is love. You add a pinch of it, it tastes like never before. Be it just bread with butter, an egg sandwich, or a simple meal. Cook with love, anything can taste the best. \n\nTry to teach your boys a few lessons about equality in gender because mannerism needs to be from home. And it\u2019s because our culture needs to change. Some bugs need to be fixed. And please do not burden them as well. Being parents, both are equally responsible for bringing up \u201cChildren\u201d equally. Yes, I meant Children and not a girl or a boy. Physically and biologically there are differences that none can change. But I am talking about other stuff. Being the only girl child in the family, along with 2 siblings who are my brothers, I had all the pampering from my father. But there were a few challenges I faced. \n\nAgain, this topic can go on and on. Let\u2019s keep it for other vlogs right?\n\nHope you enjoyed this video and I\u2019ll see you at the next\n\nTake care, everyone,\n\nLove you all\n\n=======================\nOnline purchase links\n\n1.
