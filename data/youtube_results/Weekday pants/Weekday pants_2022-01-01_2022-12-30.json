            "Video_Description": "The item I get asked about most is my pants (or trousers here in the UK). Do I tailor my trousers, where do I buy them from, and which styles are best? So in today\u2019s video, I am going to talk about my most worn and most versatile pairs of trousers, well two pairs are denim, so 3 pairs of trousers and 2 pairs of denim. \n\nAll the pants in this video are straight off the rack and come as they are. If you find it difficult to find pants that fit, then I also tell you exactly what to say to the tailor to get the same look as I go for with my pants. \n\n\u25cf Follow me on INSTAGRAM - https://www.instagram.com/harryhas/\n\u25cf Shop My Outfits - https://www.harryhas.com/shop-my-looks\n\nPants mentioned:\n\nThere are 2 versions of the Ken trouser on their website.
