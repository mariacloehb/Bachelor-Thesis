I will show you how to style everything from men's casualwear to men's formal wear. \n\nMy speciality is Yeezys but I can show how to wear all sorts of shoes, including Converse High Tops, Vans, Ultraboost, Black Airforce 1s. White Airforce 1s, Jordan 1s, and many more.\n\nBe sure to check out my lastest videos!",

There is a vast range of trail shoes available, from lightweight to durable and waterproof. Everyone's shoe choices will differ, but the greatest walking shoes have a few crucial features. The two most critical features of a walking shoe are support and comfort, which is why we chose the shoes we did.\n\nSome shoes have waterproof linings, commonly made of Gore-Tex textiles, which make them better suited for walking around in damp or rainy weather. Others will forego linings in order to be as light and breathable as possible, making them more suitable for hot weather.\n\n#walkingshoes \n#bestshoes  \n#shoes \n#walking \n-------------------------------------\n\n- DISCLOSURE -\nI am affiliated, but not sponsored by, any of the products mentioned in this video.

The finished product more than lived up to its billing. When it hit shelves for the first time in 1982 the 990 sported an elegantly understated grey colorway, and a then unheard of three-figure price tag. For avid runners and ahead of the curve tastemakers alike, the 990 was a mark of quality and superior taste. There have been updates to the design since \u201982, and more color options, but the 990\u2019s aspirational status symbol aura has never changed. Simply put, the 990 is the shoe so good, that we\u2019ve never stopped making it. The latest generation model, the 990v6 features a streamlined take on the mesh paneling and suede overlay construction, plus FuelCell and ENCAP midsole technologies. The subtle, refined modernization offers an up-to-date pinnacle experience for the 990.\n\nNew Balance MADE contains a domestic value of 70% or more.

That was then. This is now, where the benefits offered by max cushioning are recognized across the running spectrum. The ultimate application of our signature cushioning technology, the Fresh Foam More offers a pure expression of the Fresh Foam ideal \u2013 more miles, more often. The Fresh Foam X More v4 offers the pinnacle of plush underfoot cushioning. This experience starts with a midsole containing the most Fresh Foam X in a shoe to date, but doesn\u2019t end there. A wider platform allows for a balance between cushioning and support, by applying the cushioning across the entire foot. Combined with the smoother transitions provided by the largest rocker in the Fresh Foam range, the Fresh Foam X More v4 offers a complete experience, 360 degrees of comfort that retains a natural feel.\n Meets New Balance's green leaf standard\nMeets New Balance\u2019s green leaf standard: upper is made of 50% or more recycled content, and at least one midsole/outsole material contains a minimum of 3% bio-based or 5% recycled content.

            "Video_Description": "How To Clean White Leather Sneakers - New Balance 550\nWelcome back to another episode of Shoe Care Academy with Jonny Bubbles. Today we\u2019re rocking with one of the most popular sneakers of 2021-2022, the New Balance 550. \n\nMegell didn\u2019t get these all-white New Balance 550\u2019s dirty enough, so Jonny took the liberty and wrecked them even more. \n\nIf you want to see how Jonny dirtied this pair of New Balance 550 sneakers, be sure to follow us on TikTok. \n\nWith our Deep Clean Signature Bundle on deck, we\u2019re ready to give these shoes a proper clean. Stay tuned for some insane before and after comparisons\u2026spoiler alert; our sneaker cleaner did a number on these. \n\nJonny started as he always does by removing the shoe laces and inserting the Adjustable Shoe Trees. Then he put two squirts of our Sneaker Cleaning Solution into the water and got to work with the Soft Bristle Brush. \n\nAfter the first pass through with the Soft Bristle Brush, most of the surface dirt is gone, but some deeper stains remain. To attack these tough stains, Jonny used the Medium Bristle Brush. Then, he used the Stiff Bristle Brush to clean the outsole.\n\nIn order to flush out the mesh portions of these shoes and get them looking bright and white again, we\u2019re going to run them through our sneaker laundry system using our Laundry Bag and Sneaker Laundry Detergent. \n\nJonny placed the shoe in the bag along with the laces and a Sneaker Laundry Pod, and put them through a full wash cycle in the washing machine. \n\nAfter letting them air dry, all that\u2019s left is to lace them back up. \n\nSee, I told you the before and after was insane. Just look at how good these turned out. Reshoevn8r really has the most complete sneaker cleaning system, with the best sneaker cleaning solution and the ability to throw your shoes in the laundry, nothing else comes close. \n\nGot a pair of the New Balance 550?

Historically and culturally, Black people have communicated with unique words and gestures that don\u2019t have to be explained because amongst us it\u2019s all understood. From the head nod to dapping someone up to African American vernacular, these styles of communication show a collective respect and admiration for one another.\n\nCredits: \n\u00a0\nWriters\nJoe Freshgoods\nBradley Murray \n\u00a0\nTalent\nKawhi Leonard\nJoe Freshgoods\nEssie Golden\nSarah Plantz\n\u00a0\nProducers \nProducer: Miata Ramos\nProduction Coordinator: Aaliyah Gaston\nCreative Producer: Asmiet \u201cA.Z.\u201d Nega\nCreative Assistant: Jendayi Ingram\nProduction Assistant: Jose Vargas \nProduction Assistant: Malik Pinklyn \nProduction Assistant: Kalynn Youngblood\nLocation Manager: Pete Abrahams\n\u00a0\nCrew and Art Dept. \nDirector: Bradley Murray\nPhotographer: Nolis Anderson \nDirector of Photography: Allan Chiavarria\n1st AC: Celeste Barbosa \n2nd AC: Anthony Minassian \nGaffer: Eric Rosas\nKey Grip: Rickey Irizarry \nSound Mixer: Oscar Ramirez \nAD: Dante Marshall \nAssistant Photographer: Alaric Ma\nWardrobe Stylist: Talie Pepe\nMUA: Eliven \n\u00a0\nPost Production\nPost Production Supervisor: Joe Freshgoods\nEditing: Bradley Murray \nColoring: Tamarcus \u201cDuke\u201d Brown \nGraphics: Arturo \u201cChurro\u201d Lopez",

The 9060 reinterprets familiar elements sourced from classic 99X models with a warped sensibility inspired by the proudly futuristic, visible tech aesthetic of the Y2K era. Sway bars, taken from the 990, are expanded and utilized throughout the entire upper for a sense of visible motion, while wavy lines and scaled up proportions on a sculpted pod midsole place an exaggerated emphasis on the familiar cushioning platforms of ABZORB and SBS.\n\nDESCRIPTION\nThe New Balance 9060 nods to the iconic 99X series with a streamlined upper that pays homage to the era of 990s, while sporting a tongue logo inspired by the original 991 lace jewel. Crafted with a mix of mesh and suede, the bold sneaker has ABZORB and SBS cushioning.\n- New Balance 9060v1 Sea Salt\n- Mesh upper with pigskin suede overlays\n- Translucent CR device at heel\n- ABZORB and SBS cushioning\n- Rubber outsole\n\n\ud83d\udea810% OFF Reshoevn8r sneaker cleaner w my link: https://bit.ly/HESKICKS\n\ud83d\udea8Drop Front Sneaker Display Cases 10% OFF w/ code HESKICKS https://bit.ly/3hFHEmE\nSubscribe to my other trading card ripping channel http://www.youtube.com/djhes\n\n\ud83d\udea8Nike Sale Deals!  https://bit.ly/2JQwGu1\n\ud83d\udea8Adidas Sale Deals!: http://bit.ly/2mYBS1s\n\n\ud83d\udea8Youtube Camera Equipment https://www.amazon.com/shop/heskicks  \n*Products links I post may be affiliated.

This new silhouette is a streamlined take on the time-warped, classic inspiration meets modern execution concept, with a focus on distinctive features unique to competitive racing models of the \u201860s and \u201870s. The upper features classic nylon with suede accents, while reducing the overall number of panels. Curved edge \u2018N\u2019 branding inspired by pre-N logo overlay designs, and midsole stripe detail offer subtle callbacks to racing comp design elements. An exaggerated rippled design brings contemporary proportions to the defining feature of the historic, original Trackster, while a curved outsole and midfoot lift mimic the idiosyncrasies that occurred with \u201870s construction methods.\n\n\ud83d\udea810% OFF Reshoevn8r sneaker cleaner w my link: https://bit.ly/HESKICKS\n\ud83d\udea8Drop Front Sneaker Display Cases 10% OFF w/ code HESKICKS https://bit.ly/3hFHEmE\nSubscribe to my other trading card ripping channel http://www.youtube.com/djhes\n\n\ud83d\udea8Nike Sale Deals!  https://bit.ly/2JQwGu1\n\ud83d\udea8Adidas Sale Deals!: http://bit.ly/2mYBS1s\n\n\ud83d\udea8Youtube Camera Equipment https://www.amazon.com/shop/heskicks  \n*Products links I post may be affiliated.

Signature New Balance grey is applied to construction that combines technical sleekness and a crafted attention to detail. The breathable mesh upper, patterned after the M2040 silhouette, is overlaid with nubuck, hairy suede, and thick, textured leather, and features a raised bump textured leather and mesh tongue. A waxing treatment applied to this luxe material mix creates a weathered, vintage inspired look. The M2002RVA features a unique, functional addition, a detachable zip-closure mesh pouch, for storing small objects like keys and coins.\n\n\ud83d\udea8Nike Sale Deals!  https://bit.ly/2JQwGu1\n\ud83d\udea8Adidas Sale Deals!: http://bit.ly/2mYBS1s\n\n\ud83d\udea8Youtube Camera Equipment https://www.amazon.com/shop/heskicks  \n*Products links I post may be affiliated.

The biggest of those is the noticeable increase in midsole stack height to 39.5mm in the heel and 31.5mm forefoot, producing an experience similar to super shoe options from Nike and Asics.\n\nIn this video, Tom and nick chat through the two shoes and decide which they would go for if it came down to just one.\n\nCheck out our full reviews of both shoes:\n\nNew Balance FuelCell SC Elite V3: https://youtu.be/MUtsdwTCPHg\nSaucony Endorphin Pro 3: https://youtu.be/5GkhtmVS7xc\n\nListen to the monthly podcast for the latest kit news and updates: https://theruntesters.com/the-run-testers-podcast/\n\nJUMP STRAIGHT IN:\n00:00\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b - Intro\n00:20 - Stats\n00:56 - Design\n02:06 - How\u2019s The Fit?\n03:48 - The Run Test\n11:46 - Verdict\n\nSubscribe to The Run Testers for more running gear reviews:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/c/TheRunTesters?sub_confirmation=1\n\nListen to The Run Testers podcast: https://theruntesters.com/the-run-testers-podcast/\n\nBest Carbon Plate Running Shoes 2022: https://youtu.be/riWiKLgxmj8\nSaucony Endorphin Pro 3 5-Race Review: https://youtu.be/9VDE-EjD9MU\nSaucony Endorphin Pro 3 Multitester Review: https://youtu.be/5GkhtmVS7xc\nNike Vaporfly NEXT% 2 Multi-Tester Review: https://youtu.be/5o5gouEI-Jo\nAsics Metaspeed Sky+ Review: https://youtu.be/RnrciDFe_AA\nNike Alphafly NEXT% 2 Multi-Tester Review: https://youtu.be/PMMwrEEqbx4\nAdidas Adizero Adios Pro 3 Multi-Tester Review: https://youtu.be/t0KFgeK69OQ",

Technology featured remains as FuelCell with ABZORB cushioning, and they are very comfortable and responsive on feet. Traction is excellent in the indoor gym, just like the V2 performance. True to size fit, and good stability as well which makes these a fantastic all-around performer, easily one of the best basketball shoes of 2022 from my experience.\n\nLet me know your thoughts on the New Balance Two Wxy V3 in the comments!

The latest chapter in the Bodega and New Balance collaborative relationship celebrates fifteen years of operation, with a premium take on an all-time icon, the 574 Legacy. A bright primary color scheme that takes inspiration from internationally recognizable iconography like nautical signal flags is applied to a subtly altered 574 silhouette featuring a more prominent, stacked EVA platform and ENCAP system. The Bodega 574 Legacy\u2019s material mix offers a distinctive twist on familiar 574 touchstones. Classic mesh and suede upper construction adds perforations at the collar, lateral \u2018N\u2019 branding, and tongue, while the use of grey and reflective accents, and a smoky, translucent take on the original black outsole pay tribute to the timeless 574 design.\nProduct Details\nStyle #: U574LGD1\nENCAP midsole cushioning combines lightweight foam with a durable polyurethane rim to deliver all-day support\nMesh upper with suede overlays\nTongue and vamp underlays\nCo-branded tongue and sockliner\nLace closure with Bodega branded aglets\nBlack gel rubber outsole\nCustom packaging\nThis item is limited to \"3\" per order\nItem cannot be returned.\n\n\n\ud83d\udea8Shop best sneaker deals of the week I post here! http://www.collectivekicks.com/sneaker-deals\n\ud83d\udea810% OFF Reshoevn8r sneaker cleaner w my link: https://bit.ly/HESKICKS\n\ud83d\udea8Drop Front Sneaker Display Cases 10% OFF w/ code HESKICKS https://bit.ly/3hFHEmE\nSubscribe to my other trading card ripping channel http://www.youtube.com/djhes\n\n\ud83d\udea8Nike Sale Deals!  https://bit.ly/2JQwGu1\n\ud83d\udea8Adidas Sale Deals!: http://bit.ly/2mYBS1s\n\n\ud83d\udea8Youtube Camera Equipment https://www.amazon.com/shop/heskicks  \n*Products links I post may be affiliated.

            "Video_Description": "#SneakerLAB #NewBalance #NewBalance327 \n\nWe got our hands on a dirty pair of New Balance 327 sneakers and we thought to document the cleaning process to show you the best way to look after your sneakers. The 327 debuted in 2020 as \u201cthe ultimate leisure shoe\u201d. The model is inspired by runners from the 1970s \u2013 namely the New Balance 320 (1976), New Balance 355 (1977), and New Balance SuperComp (1977). The silhouette instantly became a hit for New Balance and has since become a go-to-sneaker for most sneakerheads.\n\nSneaker LAB is excited to announce our partnership with New Balance in the Asia-Pacific regions. Now you can purchase your favourite Sneaker LAB products while you\u2019re shopping for the latest pair of New Balance sneakers. Find out more here.\n\nWe used the products found in our Premium Kit and our Leather Care to clean and look after this pair. The Premium Kit consists of our Sneaker Cleaner, Sneaker Protector, Odor Protector and Premium Brush.\n\nStep 1: \n\n\ufeffFirst you will need to prepare your shoes for a deep clean! Remove the laces from the shoes and set them aside as you will clean those at a later stage. Grab our Premium Brush and dry brush off any excess dirt that may be laying on the surface of the shoe.\n\nStep 2:\n\nSpray Sneaker Cleaner around the uppers of the sneakers and focus on the heavily dirtied areas. Then grab our Premium Brush and then dip it into a container of water. Start scrubbing in a circular motion. The water and Sneaker Cleaner solution will react together creating a form that will remove the dirt on the sneakers. \n\nStep 3:\n\nYou will then turn your attention to the soles of the sneakers - you can follow the same process as before but can use more force if necessary to remove any stubborn dirt on the soles of the sneakers. \n\nStep 4:\n\nUse our Microfiber Towel to dry off the excess moisture and the last remaining dirt. Next, you will set your sneakers aside to dry. \n\nStep 5:\n\nWhilst your sneakers are drying, you can start cleaning the laces. You will cup the laces in your hand and spray Sneaker Cleaner onto them. Strat rubbing them together in your hands and then dip into a clean container of water. Continue this process until the dirt is visibly removed. Use a Microfiber Towel to ring out the excess moisture and set aside to dry with your sneakers.\n\nStep 6:\n\nWhen your sneakers and laces are dry, you can do your laces up on the sneakers. \n\nStep 7:\n\nNext, we will add our protective products. Firstly, use our Odor Protector to remove unwanted odors and prevent bad bacteria from building. If the inner soles are removable, take them out and spray the inside of the sneaker and the inner soles. \n\nStep 8:\n\nNext, use our Leather Care on the leather sections of this specific 327. If your 327s don't have leather you can skip this step. Leather Care will protect and nourish the leather panels and will prevent cracking.\n\nStep 9:\n\nLastly, you will apply Sneaker Protector to create an invisible barrier against dirt and stains. This will also make cleaning easier in the future as it will prevent dirt from setting in.\n\nStep 10:\n\nWear your shoes!\n\nThank you for watching and let us know what you think of the video in the comments below!\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\nAll products used in the video can be found here: https://www.sneakerlab.com/collections/all-products \n\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\nFollow Us:\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/sneakerlab\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@sneakerlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/SneakerLab.StayFresh\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/sneaker_lab\n\nContact Us:\nWebsite: www.sneakerlab.com\nEmail: info@sneakerlab.com",

For New Balance sneakers, generally speaking, the higher the model number, the more tech. The lower that number is, the more \"lifestyle\" the shoe leans. With the 574, New Balance broadened its reach.  \n\nAre New Balance 574 good for standing all day?\n8. New Balance 574 V2 Varsity Sneaker. These mesh and suede trainers feature a midsole cushioning that delivers all-day support.  \n\nIs New Balance 5740 comfortable?\nThe 574 has a comfortable upper, but the materials are often mediocre. The cushion is old school and not comfortable over long periods of time. But at an $80 retail price, what can you expect? It is, however, one of the best New Balance shoes of the year as a casual option. \n\nBest overall. New Balance 574 v2. \nBest classic. New Balance 990 v5. \nBest chunky.

New Balance 550.  \n\nIs 574 a running shoe?\nImage result\nThe 574 is New Balance's most popular model. The New Balance 574 is the company's archetypal casual sneaker. Initially released in 1988 as a technical running shoe, the 574 has since been reintroduced and rebranded in the early aughts as a lifestyle sneaker \n\nDescription\n\u2018The most New Balance shoe ever\u2019 says it all, right? No, actually. The 574 might be our unlikeliest icon. The 574 was built to be a reliable shoe that could do a lot of different things well rather than as a platform for revolutionary technology, or as a premium materials showcase. This unassuming, unpretentious versatility is exactly what launched the 574 into the ranks of all-time greats. As hybrid road/trail design built on a wider last than the previous generation\u2019s narrow racing silhouettes, the 574 offered a uniquely versatile mix of new, different, uncomplicated, rugged, durable, and comfortable that was adopted as a closet staple across the globe. That\u2019s why today, the 574 is synonymous with the boundary defying New Balance style, and worn by anyone. This edition, the 574 Legacy, updates the classic with an elevated aesthetic.\nProduct Details\nFeatures\nLightweight EVA foam cushioning in the midsole and heel increases comfort\nC-CAP midsole cushioning delivers durable support\nSuede and mesh upper\nSize & Fit\n  380 grams (13.4 oz) \n\nCounterfeit Products\nCounterfeit websites often use the words New Balance in the URL and have content and a layout similar to newbalance.com.

On a layer of strong, high-quality rubber, deep tread protrusions are made at the bottom, which prevent sliding on wet and smooth surfaces. Fake makers usually repeat the sole pattern quite accurately, but the official NB logo on the flat part under the heel is extremely rare on replicas. If it is still placed, it is not clear enough and does not accurately convey the outline.\nAnd a small detail near the logo gives a good answer: how to distinguish the original new balance from a fake \u2013 the absence of the R trademark registration mark in a small circle.",

An extension of the beauty shop, where women can come together and reveal the innermost parts of themselves and uplift one another in the process. Whether it's admiring her poppin\u2019 nails or her fly fit, sharing what her stylist did with her flawless knotless braids, or simply a welcoming smile. The restroom is often the place where women remind each other that they are that girl.\n\nCredits:\nWriters\nBradley Murray \nAsmiet Nega\nMiata Ramos\nAaliyah Gaston \nJendayi Ingram\n\nTalent \nStorm Reid\nCassie Osuji\nShay Lewis \nBethlehem Moore \nMarianne Aquino \n\nProducers\nProducer: Miata Ramos\nProduction Coordinator: Aaliyah Gaston\nCreative Producer: Asmiet \u201cA.Z.\u201d Nega\nCreative Assistant: Jendayi Ingram\nProduction Assistant: Jose Vargas \nProduction Assistant: Malik Pinklyn \nProduction Assistant: Kalynn Youngblood\n\nCrew and Art Dept. \nDirector: Bradley Murray\nPhotographer:  Alaric Ma\nDirector of Photography: Allan Chiavarria\n1st AC: Celeste Barbosa \n2nd AC: Anthony Minassian \nGaffer: Eric Rosas\nSound Mixer: Oscar Ramirez \nAD: Asmiet \u201cA.Z.\u201d Nega\nWardrobe Stylist: Jason Bolden\nMUA: Marquis Ward \nMUA: Melanesia Hunter \n \nPost Production\nPost Production Supervisor: Joe Freshgoods\nEditor: Priscilla Perez\nColoring: Tamarcus \u201cDuke\u201d Brown \nGraphics: Arturo \u201cChurro\u201d Lopez",

            "Video_Description": "The New Balance Fresh Foam 1080v12 needs little introduction. The last two versions of the shoe - the v10 and v11 \u2013 have been incredibly popular with runners looking for a jack of all trades, designed for everything from easy miles all the way up to race day.\n\nAccording to New Balance, it\u2019s the best running shoe they make, which may seem like a bold claim but in this case, it\u2019s focused more on versatility than overall performance.\n\nAt its core, the 1080v12 is a cushioned daily shoe that\u2019s designed to be both comfortable but also offer a good level of responsiveness for faster training days. It\u2019s never going to compete with race shoes, but it\u2019s a daily trainer that ticks a lot of boxes.\n\nCheck out The Run Testers podcast:\n\nApple Podcasts: https://theruntesters.com/the-run-testers-podcast/\n\nJUMP STRAIGHT IN:\n00:00\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b - Intro\n00:18 - Stats\n00:34 - Design\n01:44 - How\u2019s The Fit?\n02:40 - The Run Test\n08:12 \u2013 Should You Buy It?\n\nSubscribe to The Run Testers for more running gear reviews:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/c/TheRunTesters?sub_confirmation=1\n\nSome other videos you might find useful:\n\nBrooks Glycerin 20 Review: https://youtu.be/Hd8v3MxFSPc\nNike React Infinity Run Flyknit 3 Multi-Tester Review: https://youtu.be/dvmLhmmiNSQ\nBrooks Glycerin 20 Vs New Balance Fresh Foam More V3: https://youtu.be/OdTQXd9sfKo\nBest Cushioned Running Shoes: https://youtu.be/LaZNwLEJCUA\nNike Pegasus 39 vs Nike Infinity Run 3: https://youtu.be/Azj7sMlSRtg\nBest Running Shoes 2022: https://youtu.be/1qpRfG2mxTs\nPuma Velocity Nitro 2 Multi-Tester Review: https://youtu.be/PW40-pS5dTE",

            "Video_Description": "The New Balance 2002R Protection Pack was one of the best releases of last year which led to many in the sneaker game begging for an encore or restock of the originals. Luckily, NB has answered our prayers & blessed us with three new \u2018Protection Pack\u2019 colorways dubbed Vintage Orange, Mirage Grey, & lastly the one we have in the studio today: Dark Navy & Mallard Blue. The three pairs have seen a release in the EU but no word on when they will receive an official stateside drop. I love what NB has been doing as of late with high quality materials & versatile sneakers which is what propelled me to pick up this sneaker early. Let me know what you guys think down below about not only this colorway, but the 2002R silhouette as a whole.

            "Video_Description": "The On Cloudmonster is a max cushioned shoe that features a thick Helion Superfoam midsole foam for comfort and cushioning. That foam combines with the full-length Speedboard and Cloudtec design to produce rebound and minimise impact over easy day sessions.\n\nThe New Balance Fresh Foam More v3 is a shoe that, unsurprisingly, has a lot more cushioning than you\u2019ll find in other road shoes in the New Balance range. That midsole is a thick chunk of the same Fresh Foam you\u2019ll find in other popular options like 1080v11 and 860v12 - a foam that offers a good balance between cushioning and responsiveness.\n\nBut which of these two options is worth buying for your next cushioned shoe?

            "Video_Channel_Title": "Sneaker LAB",
            "Video_Description": "#SneakerLAB #NewBalance #newbalance550 \n\nWe got our hands on a dirty pair of New Balance 550 sneakers and we thought to document the cleaning process to show you the best way to look after your sneakers. The 550 was originally released in 1989 with the 550 following the industry\u2019s trend of brands offering a low-top counterpart to their marquee hoops-ready footwear. This basketball sneaker then received a new lease of life through Aim\u00e9 Leon Dore\u2019s (ALD) drop of the 550. On September 21st 2020, Teddy Santis, ALD\u2019s founder shifted the trajectory of both New Balance and ALD by unveiling four colorways of the 550 and it has since become a must have for all sneakerheads around the globe.\n\nSneaker LAB is excited to announce our partnership with New Balance in the Asia-Pacific regions. Now you can purchase your favourite Sneaker LAB products while you\u2019re shopping for the latest pair of New Balance sneakers. Find out more here.\n\nWe used the products found in our Premium Kit and our Leather Care to clean and look after this pair. The Premium Kit consists of our Sneaker Cleaner, Sneaker Protector, Odor Protector and Premium Brush.\n\nStep 1: \n\ufeffFirst you will need to prepare your shoes for a deep clean! Remove the laces from the shoes and set them aside as you will clean those at a later stage. Grab our Premium Brush and dry brush off any excess dirt that may be laying on the surface of the shoe.\n\nStep 2:\nSpray Sneaker Cleaner around the uppers of the sneakers and focus on the heavily dirtied areas. Then grab our Premium Brush and then dip into a container of water. Start scrubbing in a circular motion. The water and Sneaker Cleaner solution will react together creating a form that will remove the dirt on the sneakers. On this particular model of 550, the majority of the sneaker is made up of leather but there are mesh panels that will need more attention when cleaning. Use more Sneaker Cleaner on these areas, and dip the Premium Brush into water and scrub in a circular motion. This process may need repeating to lift out the dirt that has embedded itself into material.\n\nStep 3:\nYou will then turn your attention to the soles of the sneakers - you can follow the same process as before but can use more force if necessary to remove any stubborn dirt on the soles of the sneakers. \n\nStep 4:\nWe then used our Sneaker Wipes to do spot cleans and touch ups on those hard to reach places. The wipes provide a convenient way of scrubbing away dirt on materials like mesh.\n\nStep 5:\nUse our Microfiber Towel to dry off the excess moisture and the last remaining dirt. Next, you will set your sneakers aside to dry. \n\nStep 6:\nWhilst your sneakers are drying, you can start cleaning the laces. You will cup the laces in your hand and spray Sneaker Cleaner onto them. Strat rubbing them together in your hands and then dip into a clean container of water. Continue this process until the dirt is visibly removed. Use a Microfiber Towel to ring out the excess moisture and set aside to dry with your sneakers.\n\nStep 7:\nWhen your sneakers and laces are dry, you can do your laces up on the sneakers. \n\nStep 8:\nNext we will add our protective products. Firstly, use our Odor Protector to remove unwanted odors and prevent bad bacteria from building. If the inner soles are removable, take them out and spray the inside of the sneaker and the inner soles. \n\nStep 9:\nNext, use our Leather Care on the leather sections of this specific 550. If your 550s don't have leather you can skip this step. Leather Care will protect and nourish the leather panels and will prevent cracking.\n\nStep 10:\n\nLastly, you will apply Sneaker Protector to the mesh, tongue and laces of the sneakers to create an invisible barrier against dirt and stains. This will also make cleaning easier in the future as it will prevent dirt from setting in.\n\nStep 11:\n\nWear your shoes! \n\nThank you for watching and let us know what you think of the video in the comments below!\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\nAll products used in the video can be found here: https://www.sneakerlab.com/collections/all-products \n\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\nFollow Us:\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/sneakerlab\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@sneakerlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/SneakerLab.StayFresh\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/sneaker_lab\n\nContact Us:\nWebsite: www.sneakerlab.com\nEmail: info@sneakerlab.com",

So far I\u2019ve absolutely enjoyed playing in these, as they provide excellent cushioning and the traction is fantastic as well, very loud and squeaky in the indoor gym. Perhaps the only thing I didn\u2019t like is the look of it, or at least this particular \u201cNeon Lights\u201d colorway.\n\nLet me know your thoughts on the New Balance TWO WXY 2 down in the comments.

            "Video_Description": "In this review, I talk about why the New Balance 990v3 is one of the best sneakers of the last decade both from a quality and a style perspective. The New Balance 990 V3 (M990GY3) initially released back in 2012 and it is still, in my opinion, one of the best sneaker models of the past decade. It's not just me thinking this; many brands have picked up the 990v3 and released their own spin on the model, such as the JJJJound 990v3 duo in Olive and Brown, the Bodega collaboration, the Joe Fresh Goods pair, as well as the pairs in the Teddy Santis pack. And these are only in the past year! \n\nSome of my personal favorites are the Kith 990v3 \u201cGenesis\u201d as well as the No Vacancy Inn collaboration pair! The grey pair will always be a winner as well; it\u2019s just too clean.\n\nThe 990v3 is definitely a mainstay sneaker model even if this \"dad\" shoe trend goes away, and I don't see this model losing popularity at all. It is definitely worth taking a look at the sneaker yourself and feel the quality + craftsmanship in hand! I'll try my best to show that in this video as well.\n\n0:00 Unboxing\n0:12 Intro\n1:05 Reasons to get the 990v3\n3:00 Why you might not want the 990v3\n4:04 Detailed look at the shoe\n6:19 Sizing Recommendation\n7:10 Huge thank you to all the subscribers!\n\nCheck out my review on the 990v3 from the Teddy Santis collection! https://youtu.be/oCheJ6sEG6w\n\nMusic Credit:\nKobe Banks - addiction\nhttps://soundcloud.com/thekobebanks/addiction-ft-dr-malcolm-lex\n\nIn terms how I\u2019d rank these, I\u2019d definitely prefer a pair of these over the New Balance 550. NB 550\u2019s are clean (especially the Burgundy Cyan pair and the ALD collab), but the 990 V3 is hands down my pick.",

How's the cushioning? Could there be any problems? How does this compare to the Aime Leon Dore collaboration pairs? Let's find out...\n\nNon-affiliated J-Crew link in case you want a pair:\nhttps://www.jcrew.com/p/mens/categories/shoes/sneakers/new-balance-550-sneakers/BE902?display=all&fit=Classic&color_name=white-/-burgundy&colorProductCode=BE902\n\nCheck out my previous video on the New Balance 550 Burgundy/Cyan here! \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPkf2lD47ds\n\nMusic Credit:\nDJ Grumble - SMDHHH\nhttps://soundcloud.com/gbeats/smdhhh?utm_source=clipboard&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=social_sharing\n\nWhich NB 550 do you prefer?

            "Video_Description": "#newbalance #newbalance327 #newbalancehombre \n\nHow do I know if my New Balance 327 is real?\nOriginal New Balance shoes have the logo on the outside. On the counterfeits you'll find a mirror image of the letter 'N'. In the original shoes it's in the right place. In most of the versions logo is lined with a material in a different color, usually the same as the other details. \n\nHow do you know if new balances are real?\nImage result for new balance 327 spot fake\nNew Balance retail boxes feature a label on the side detailing style name, size, colour code, and a bar code number. Check that the bar code number matches the number detailed on the tongue labels. The New Balance logo is often found on the insole. \n\nAre New Balance 327 Made in China?\nWhere is the New Balance 327 made? Unlike the exclusive 'Made in' models, the NB 327 is made in China \n\nWhy is New Balance 327 so popular?\nImage result\nNew Balance sneakers are a constant reminder of how well archival and modern influences can mesh. The 327 is a great example of this, offering a '70s-inspired silhouette with fresh fabrics and modern spins on the entire aesthetic. Both comfy and stylish, it easily belongs in any summer wardrobe. \n\nWho made New Balance 327?\ndesigner Charlotte Lee\nNew Balance designer Charlotte Lee is breaking through those preconceived ideas of how this all works. After working with the brand for only six years, Lee developed the instant-classic future-retro 327, fusing heritage and modern elements to create a new type of heat around New Balance.\n\nCan New Balance 327 be washed?\nThe suggested cleaning method for New Balance shoes is to use a light bristle brush (old tooth brush) and a light detergent (dish washing or laundry). Scrub the shoes with the brush and use a damp cloth to wipe clean. You can also immerse them in water. Allow shoes to air dry thoroughly for about twenty-four hours. \n\nWhat sneakers does Jennifer Aniston wear?\nImage result\nAside from being an Aniston-loved sneaker, wearers love the New Balance 327 shoes for their comfortable cushioned support and stylish, vintage nod",

            "Video_Description": "#SneakerLAB #newbalance #Newbalancexc-72\n\nToday we\u2019re working with a dirty pair of the New Balance XC-72. The XC-72 is the epitome of retro-futurism which takes design inspiration from the 70's and gives it a modern twist. The XC-72 first released in 2021 and has become a popular silhouette along with multiple new releases from New Balance.\n\nToday we're cleaning the Moonbeam Black colorway of the New Balance XC-72.\n\nSneaker LAB is excited to announce our partnership with New Balance in the Asia-Pacific regions. Now you can purchase your favourite Sneaker LAB products while you\u2019re shopping for the latest pair of New Balance sneakers. Find out more here.\n\nWe used the products found in our Premium Kit to clean and look after this pair. The Premium Kit consists of our Sneaker Cleaner, Sneaker Protector, Odor Protector and Premium Brush.\n\nStep 1:\n\nStart by removing the laces of your dirty New Balance XC-72 sneakers and grab our Premium Brush dry brush off any excess dirt. This will remove the excess dust and dirt laying on top of the material and will prevent it mixing when the water and cleaning solution is applied. \n\nStep 2:\n\nApply Sneaker Cleaner around the uppers of the sneaker. Then you will need to dip your brush into a container of water and drop off the excess liquid. First you will clean the suede panels of the sneaker and concentrate on those sections as you will want to avoid any bleeding of the suede's color. Since it is suede, scrub in one direction and try drying the sections with our Microfiber Towel once cleaned to preserve the suede of the sneaker. \n\nThen you will make your way to mesh sections of the shoe, you can use more water here if needed. \n\nSneaker LAB Sneaker Cleaner New Balance XC-72\n\nStep 3:\n\nMove your way down to the soles and midsoles of the sneakers. Spray Sneaker Cleaner around the dirty areas of the sole and dip your brush in water. Start scrubbing to remove the dirt and use more force where necessary to remove that stubborn dirt that is found on the soles of the sneakers.\n\nSneaker Cleaner New Balance XC-72\n\nStep 4:\n\nSet the sneakers aside to dry!\n\nStep 5:\n\nYou will now turn your attention to the laces of the sneakers. Cup the laces in your hands and spray Sneaker Cleaner around them. Scrub together in the palms of your hands and dip into a clean container of water. Continue this process until your laces look clean. Set aside to dry.\n\nStep 6:\n\nWhen your sneakers and laces are dry, lace up your sneakers and prepare to use our protective products.\n\nStep 7:\n\nGrab our Odor Protector and spray inside the sneakers. If the inner sole is removable, take it out and spray that as well. The Odor Protector will not only remove the unwanted odor found in your footwear but it will be a preventative method for bad bacteria building up.\n\nSneaker LAB Odor Protector New Balance XC-72\n\nStep 8:\n\nUse our Sneaker Protector to create an invisible protective layer to prevent dirt and stains from setting in. Our Sneaker Protector will also make any future cleaning easier! Let the Sneaker Protector and Odor protector dry overnight.\n\nSneaker LAB Sneaker Protector New Balance XC-72\n\nStep 9:\n\nOnce everything is dry and your sneakers are looking clean, its time to wear them!\n\nThank you for watching and let us know what you think of the video in the comments below!\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\nAll products used in the video can be found here: https://www.sneakerlab.com/collections/all-products \n\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\nFollow Us:\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/sneakerlab\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@sneakerlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/SneakerLab.StayFresh\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/sneaker_lab\n\nContact Us:\nWebsite: www.sneakerlab.com\nEmail: info@sneakerlab.com",

            "Video_Description": "New Balance says that the Fresh Foam X 880v12 is a shoe that DOES IT ALL! Are they right? The Fresh Foam X 880v12 is a neutral, moderate cushion daily trainer running shoe from New Balance that is designed to help you pack in the miles without getting in your way. The 880 series running shoe is the less-cushioned little sibling of the more-cushioned 1080 series, and it uses the same formulation of Fresh Foam X in the heel and midsole while adding some more responsive foam in the forefoot. It also has extra rubber on the outsole making the 880v12 a super-durable daily trainer running shoe.\n\nI'm still relatively new to New Balance (is that weird to say?), so I'm curious to hear from you about your experience in the 880s or any of the New Balance line of running shoes.

            "Video_Description": "The New Balance 574 Yurt is one of those shoes that easy to spot from far away. It has a wide array of materials used on the shoe, and a very unique look. The shoe was designed in collaboration with well known designer Salehe Bembury, and he did not disappoint. In this video, we talk all about the shoe and how it came about to get a whistle attached to the back of it along with its unique design. Men's fashion is slowly catching up to women's but not nearly as quick as it should be. \n\n0:00 Intro \n0:23 Salehe Bembury\n0:52 Why the Whistle\n2:09 This Shoe has a RollBar\n3:36 The Sole\n4:05 Comfort\n4:26 Sizing\n4:54 Pricing\n\nOther Videos you might like\n\nNew Balance 574 Review: https://youtu.be/Aymj0KgnsTs\n\nAir Max 1 x Patta Review: https://youtu.be/YTnZuy7ZvOk\n\nReebok Club C85 Vintage Review: https://youtu.be/kRkR0VUwaOA\n\nNew Balance 550 review: https://youtu.be/E54C8pvjLgA",

The New Balance FuelCell Shift TR could definitely be a good option to explore if you want a budget-friendly option.\n\nIn this New Balance FuelCell Shift TR review, I'll cover a variety of topics to help you decide if this shoe is worth it for your needs.\n\n0:00 Pros\n2:10 Cons\n4:31 Performance\n7:58 Price\n8:17 Who are these best for?\n9:00 Sizing and Fit\n9:33 Weight, Drop, and Insole\n9:51 Construction Breakdown\n11:45 Final Thoughts\n\nAcross the board, I thought the New Balance FuelCell Shift TR did a good job for versatile training and more casual training days.\n\nI like the comfort of the FuelCell midsole and the FitWeave Lite upper is lightweight, secure, and breathable.\n\nMy main gripe with this model is the sizing. This shoe's sizing is all over the place, so definitely make sure you do your research on sizing before investing.\n\nIf you have additional questions on the New Balance FuelCell Shift TR, drop a comment below or reach out to me personally via Instagram (@jake_boly or @that_fit_friend).\n\n#newbalance #trainingshoes #shoereview \n\nMORE SHOE CONTENT\n\nBest HIIT Shoes: https://thatfitfriend.com/best-hiit-shoes/\n\nBest Cross-Training Shoes: https://thatfitfriend.com/best-cross-training-shoes/\n\nBest CrossFit Shoes: https://thatfitfriend.com/best-crossfit-shoes/\n\nBest Barefoot Shoes: https://thatfitfriend.com/best-barefoot-shoes/\n\nBest Hybrid Training Shoes: https://thatfitfriend.com/best-training-shoes-running-lifting/",
