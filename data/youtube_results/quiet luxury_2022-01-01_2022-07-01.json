            "Video_Description": "Welcome to our video listing the Top 8 Old Money Luxury Bags!\n\nYou have probably heard about the old money aesthetic or old money fashion. Although it has been trending now, it is a classic style that is based on royalty and wealthy families of the 20th century. Forget about loud logos and tiktok fashion trends, this is quiet luxury at its finest.\n\nThe old money aesthetic is not about imitating the mega wealthy of today, is about a classic and elegant style that is timeless. Here on this video I\u2019ll show you 8 amazing bags that are definitely old money, and are so understated you might not know.\n\nThese are bags that are very quiet and unknown to the masses, only those in the know can recognize these bags. I kept out of this list bags from Herm\u00e8s and Chanel, not because they aren\u2019t old money, but because at this point I believe they are recognizable even to those outside of the fashion world.\n\n00:00 - Intro\n\n01:18 - 8.

Unjung-dong is also well-known as a high-end residential complex with luxurious houses in Pangyo. It used to be a place I had considered once before, but it has become a place that is difficult to even look at because it has climbed too high. So on a quiet Sunday morning, I went for a walk and a forest tour. Then, shall we walk together while looking at the scenery of Unjung-dong, Pangyo, Seongnam?\n\n\uc548\ub155\ud558\uc138\uc694?

Although it has been trending now, it is a classic style that is based on royalty and wealthy families of the 20th century.\n\nForget about loud logos and tiktok fashion trends, this is quiet luxury at its finest.\n\nThe old money aesthetic also has a lot to do with the nautical and equestrian worlds, and with brands that represent that style. Also think about mansions on Lake Como or summer in the Hamptons.\n\nThe old money aesthetic is not about imitating the mega wealthy of today, is about a classic and elegant style that is timeless.\n\nAt the end of the video there is a bonus fact about the most exclusive watch in the world that may surprise you.\n\n00:00 - Intro\n01:15 - 10.

Acclaimed Architect Cathy Purple Cherry of Purple Cherry Architects walked us through the expansive property of her longtime client, which consists of an impressive nine structures, four of which were pre-existing, and notably entails the main house, party barn, carriage house, pottery studio, greenhouse, and boat house. Fans of Nancy Meyers interiors know it is one of the top interior design trends 2022, and this home is a prime example of coastal grandmother decor with white millwork, classic Americana design and breathtaking landscape views. The gorgeous, lush, and significant landscape doubles as a fully operable farm with striking views of seemingly infinite pastures.  The full build-out and renovation spanned over the course of a decade and functions today as the client's family\u2019s weekend getaway where they host holidays, parties, and events.   The overall look and style of this estate is a balanced mixture of neo-colonial, transitional, and coastal, with a touch of organic modern with a multi-layered textural neutral color palette that thematically shows up throughout the structures.  The family-oriented design that sits carefully within the crafted architectural details makes this home one to truly remember. #stealthwealth #quietluxury \n\n\nChapters:\n00:00 - About the Designer\n01:23 - About the Project\n02:54 - Kitchen\n04:02 - Butler\u2019s Pantry\n04:22 - Dining Room\n05:11 - Utilitizing Built-Ins\n05:47 - Home Office\n06:17 - Creating a Hidden Bookcase Door\n06:45 - Billiards Room\n07:27 - The Bar\n08:13 - Wine Dining Room\n09:00 - Conditioned Wine Cellar\n09:27 - Theater Room\n10:01 - Mudroom\n11:11 - Guest Bedroom\n12:00 - Incorporating Interior Windows\n12:57 - Guest Bathroom\n13:49 - Laundry Room\n14:46 - Designing a Bunk Room\n15:29 - Closing\n\nFollow us on Instagram: \nhttps://instagram.com/designerhometours/\n\nFollow us on TikTok: \nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@designerhometours/\n\nSubmit a Project:\nhttps://bit.ly/Project--Submission\n\n#InteriorDesigner #coastalgrandmother  #DesignerHomeTours #behindthedesign #farmhousedecor #farmhousekitchen \n\nMB01UIOJEWYET0S\nMB01L0D0IMSGS1P",

They carry their branding quietly and many bear the hallmarks of elegant good taste.  \n\nI have the Mulberry Darley small shoulder bag in quilted leather - a look alike to the attractive Chanel Business Affinity (but a fraction of the price and much better made!); the Aspinal of London Mayfair bag, size mini; one of the famous Anya Hindmarch clutches; and a quirky Lulu Guinness Oyster bag bought as a gift for someone.\n\nPlease let me know what you think of these brands and if you own or would consider buying one of them! x",

            "Video_Description": "Welcome to our video listing the Top 10 Quiet Luxury Bags!\n\nWhen it comes to luxury there are basically two types of brands, the loud and the quiet ones. We all know the loud ones; they are always on your face with big logos and marketing campaigns, like Louis Vuitton and Gucci for example. We love them, but if you believe that less is more then you are definitely a fan of quiet luxury.\n\nQuiet luxury brands offer products with subtle or no markings. Quiet luxury is not centered around the logo, or showing off wealth and status, instead, it\u2019s all about the beauty, quality, and craftsmanship of the product. \n\nHere I\u2019ll show you 10 bags that perfectly represent quiet luxury, I\u2019m sure you will love them! Some bags on this list are pretty well known but that doesn\u2019t mean it isn\u2019t quiet luxury. \n\nIf you would like to know more about quiet luxury make sure to check my video about the top 10 quiet luxury brands!\n\n00:00 - Intro\n\n01:19 - 10.
