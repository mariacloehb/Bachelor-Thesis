Well, a lot of you asked if I could do some other popular stores too, so I decided to do one of my favourites next, COS. \n\nNow COS is a little bit more expensive than UNIQLO, but not by much these days and I normally find their clothing fits a lot better, it\u2019s more interesting and the quality is better too. It's been a while since I bought anything from COS, for no reason really. I just haven\u2019t been buying much recently, but let\u2019s see if they are still one of the best for basics out there. \n\nFor this clothing haul, I picked up some t-shirts, outerwear, trousers and denim so I have all areas covered so it should give us a good idea on the quality. \n\n\u25cf Follow me on INSTAGRAM - https://www.instagram.com/harryhas/\n\u25cf Shop My Outfits - https://www.harryhas.com/shop-my-looks\n\nItems from COS\n\nRegular T-shirt - https://rstyle.me/+pJ43TlAh5nqk5M4hwodFCw\nBrushed Cotton T-shirt - https://rstyle.me/+FcxBeIEs0V6UvUqySxElww\nHeavyweight Long Sleeve - https://rstyle.me/+Gc91CctcHesHTixxgs6T4w\nMid-Weight Knitted Jumper - https://rstyle.me/+P-mC6Kix_ZqjFaAqnnNWNQ\nLightweight Overshirt - https://rstyle.me/+kXxmxk9owemxobb2GG6brQ\nBlack Trousers - https://rstyle.me/+UUrmhit1LWcLGgarwG9Eqg\nMid Blue Denim - https://rstyle.me/+XJGjI3Y3DMNi1R7b5WTqrg\n\nOther items I\u2019m wearing\n\nJeans I am wearing - https://rstyle.me/+WYsgLAxpLNMOO0_Kn_ARng\nTrousers I am wearing - https://www.nn07.com/en/uk/bill-1700-trouser-black\nConverse Black - https://rstyle.me/+HSYTcWoHkN-wdndF7GxYyQ\nConverse White - https://rstyle.me/+GHbIUVfEP8Uk8JC_r47T0A\n\n\nSome of the links above are affiliate links.
