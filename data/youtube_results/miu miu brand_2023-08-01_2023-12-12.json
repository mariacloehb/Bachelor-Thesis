            "Video_Description": "Moments of beauty, touches of history, pieces of life. The Spring/Summer 2024 Miu\r Miu collection by Miuccia Prada explores a rationale of beauty today - exploding,\r redressing.\n\nIn an ever-changing world, beauty must echo the complexity of our era: this\r collection is a search for a reflective definition, a reactive address of beauty for\r modern times. Quotations of past styles emphasise the importance and meaning of\r history - they are embedded with the memories of the values of past times,\r reevaluated. Instead of rigid paradigms, there is a radical expansion, a rich plurality.\r Not beauty, but beauties, an embracing of unique characters, the joy of life.\n\nA significance is afforded to the individual, expressed through both fashion and cast.\r A citing of history can simultaneously be a tool for learning, a manner of discovering\r meaning, and a profound interrelation to humanity. It is a means to connect with \rpeople, their lives, their experience. Traces of living mark the clothes - washing,\r distressing, marked suedes and leathers, an exaggeration of the passage of time \rexpressive of the notion of prior use, of existing love.\n\nPrototypical ideas of clothing hold significance. Swimwear, sportswear, evening wear.\r Men\u2019s bathing slips, kid-mohair tailoring, antique underwear, New Balance 530,\r Church\u2019s Shanghai, elegant dresses in embroideries and brocades. The notion of\r meaningful design is expressed through a connection with intention, with objective \rand benefit.\n\nGarments devised for specific purpose, functions and events are here remixed in\runanticipated combinations - a maillot de bain with a cocktail dress, a petticoat with \ra blazer. Their juxtapositions convey a modern style that, in turn, is a mirror of\r different lives, the multiplicity of contemporary identity and the positivity of the\r endless possibilities of today.\n\nThe interventions forged between Miu Miu and contemporary artists are never\r devised as embellishment to fashion: independent and free, they evince a congruent\r intellectual viewpoint, each speaking about the present. This season, Qatari-\rAmerican artist Sophia Al-Maria situates the Miu Miu show within a landscape of\r technological ruins, an imaginary history invented inside the Palais d\u2019I\u00e9na created in\rcollaboration with OMA.\n\nAl-Maria\u2019s specially-created work, Gravity & Grace, depicts a confrontation between\r reality and fantasy - a reflection of the intention of her body of work as a whole.\rThrough this, she explores the meaning of storytelling, through the history of\rhumanity to today - to transmit the past, share the present and imagine the future.\n\nThe character cast included Eddy Aldridge, May Andersen, Mame Bineta Sane, Petra \rCollins, Rosemary Ferguson, Amelia Gray Hamlin, Gigi Hadid, Troye Sivan, Liu \rWen, Karolin Wolter and Cailee Spaeny who closed the show.\n\n#MiuMiu \n#MiuMiuSS24\n#MiucciaPrada",

            "Video_Description": "For Fall/Winter 2023, Miu Miu is pleased to announce a collaboration with @Churchs1873 shoes, infusing the \rformality of the heritage brand with the free spirit the Miu Miu name represents. The launch is\r celebrated by a still and moving image campaign using a timelessly beautiful gentleman\u2019s armchair, \rrichly upholstered in archive Miu Miu fabric, as a stage. \n\nMultiple positions and gestures are adopted by models wearing the Miu Miu ready-to-wear collection\r with the Church\u2019s X Miu Miu brogue and double monk strap shoe. The comfort of the armchair and\r languor of the poses is in direct contrast to the polite and conventional perception of the designs. \n\nCrafted in glossed brushed leather and in classic shades of black and tobacco the Church\u2019s X Miu Miu \rshoes are rounded and broader in shape than the originals that inspire them. A malleable, non-slip and\r sporty moulded rubber sole replaces leather. The patterned serration that characterizes both styles is in \rplace. Further rich detailing includes the Miu Miu logo on the tongues of the shoes and embossed into\r the sides of the soles and the Church\u2019s X Miu Miu logo printed on the insoles. The double monk strap \rshoes are further embellished with the classic wing-tip motif that emphasizes the British foundations of\r Church\u2019s.\n\nMiu Miu\u2019s signature play between the traditional and the contemporary is upheld. The reassurance of \rthe familiar is at once celebrated and subverted \u2013 undone - to create something new.\n\nChurch's X Miu Miu products will be available in avant-premi\u00e8re on miumiu.com from August 29 and\r in Miu Miu stores from September 6th.\n\nCredits:\r\nPhotographer: Lengua\r\nCreative direction: Edward Quarmby\r\nStylist: Lotta Volkova\r\nModels: Rejoice Chuol, Annabelle Weatherly\n\n#ChurchsXMiuMiu",
